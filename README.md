First year group project with Dan, Seddik, Claudiu and Adam, moved from the university's server. <br/>
NOTE: This project is full of absolute <b>HORRENDOUS</b>, <b>AWFUL</b>, <b>INEFFICIENT</b>, <b>POORLY TESTED</b>, <b>CRAPPY</b> code, with <b>NO COMMENTS</b> whatsoever as we were all unexperienced first year students. <br/>
